# Week 4: Getting Started with React  
  
We are using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started). To do so, make sure it is installed, and then just call it with `npx create-react-app`...
  
i.e.
```
# install
npm install create-react-app

# create a new app
npx create-react-app my-app

# cd into the app, if you'd like
cd my-app
```
